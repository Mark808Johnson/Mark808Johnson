- 👋 Hi, I’m Mark :)

- 💻 I’m interested in data-science, web-development and problem-solving in general. Most familiar with object-orientated programming using Python but always keen to learn new, challenging things. Presently developing my knowledge of full-stack development through Helsinki University's Full-Stack Open course, as well as Python Flask and Django.      

- 👀 Seeking internship/junior developer positions in Finland.

- ⛷️ In my spare time I play guitar, sing tenor, and keep active with football and skiing.
